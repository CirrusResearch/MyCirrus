## Custom Format

If you are making your own webhook service or using it with a service not listed above you can use the custom format.

### Basics

When you recieve a webhook request from Optimus Cloud it includes the message in JSON format as shown below.

```json
{
  "text": "Webhook test message from Optimus Cloud",
  "icon": "https://optimus-cloud.co.uk/images/webhook-icon.png",
  "name": "Optimus Cloud",
  "raw": null
}
```

### Advanced

The **text** property includes a preformatted message representing the notification as you would see in an email or SMS message.

If you want to access more detailed information about the notification the **raw** property contains an object representing the notification information as it came from the instrument.

```json
{
  "text": "G123456: Noise Alert '85dB 1s' 03/05/2018 11:37:13",
  "icon": "https://optimus-cloud.co.uk/images/webhook-icon.png",
  "name": "Optimus Cloud",
  "raw": {
    "Time": "2018-05-03T11:37:13",
    "Name": "85dB 1s"
  }
}
```

The actual contents depend on the type of trigger and instrument used but it will contain at least the Time, Name and Instrument.

*The **raw** property is not available when using the Test button on the website*
